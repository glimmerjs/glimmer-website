      Glimmer is one of the fastest DOM rendering engines, delivering
      exceptional performance for initial renders as well as updates.
      Architected like a virtual machine (VM), Glimmer compiles your templates
      into low-level code so it can run as fast as possible—without sacrificing
      ease of use.

    <h2>Productive out of the box</h2>

    <p>
       Don’t waste days getting your application compiling. Glimmer apps are
       standalone, but built with the powerful Ember CLI, so you get a
       production-ready build pipeline in seconds. No fussy configuration files
       needed to produce small and svelte Glimmer apps that are a fraction of the
       size of similar apps.

    <h2>From UI components to apps</h2>

    <p>
       Because Glimmer powers the components in Ember, there’s a battle-tested,
       full-stack framework waiting for you&mdash;if you need it. Just drop your Glimmer
       components into an Ember app. You won’t need to change a thing. Or drop your
       component into your existing app, regardless of technology, it'll just work.
